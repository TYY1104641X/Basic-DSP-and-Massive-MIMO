# Massive-MIMO and FFT/PSD

@ Yuanyuan Tang

Simulated error probability of Massive MIMO  system

1) The project contains one Massive MIMO channel model, 3 linear precoder transceivers.

    a) MRTZF

    b) ZFBF

    c) MMSE


2) This project contains one FFT-Autocorrelation-PSD file


3) Wiki contains a summary of key components of DSP
